Running webiss on Android
=========================

Install nodejs
--------------

You can install nodejs using this site:

    http://nodejs.org/

Install Cordova
---------------

Once nodejs is installed you can install cordova using:

    sudo npm install -g cordova

Install Android Development Tools (ADT)
---------------------------------------

You'll need to install the ADT which can be dowloaded from here:

    http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

NOTE: If you install the 64-bit version on Ubuntu, you'll need to follow the
following additional instructions:

    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386
    sudo apt-get install lib32z1

The Android packages then need to be installed following these directions:

    http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/adding-packages.html
    
    Note: currently Android 17 is being used.

Once the packages are installed you'll need to add the ADT to the path. This
can be done by adding the following to your ~/.bashrc:

    export PATH=$PATH:$ADT_PATH/sdk/platform-tools:$ADT_PATH/sdk/tools

where $ADT_PATH is the path to your local adt installation. For example:

    ~/Development/adt-bundle

Then running:

    source ~/.bashrc


Configuring the project
-----------------------

The plugins required by webiss-mobile can be installed by running:

    make

    in this directory.

Change into the platforms/android folder, and run:

    android update project --subprojects --path .

Now back in the webiss-mobile directory the cordova app can be built using:

    cordova build

You can test the app in two ways:

    cordova emulate android # test on an emulator (you must create one first)
    OR
    cordova run android # test on a device (must be plugged in, and develper enabled)

============================================================================

Running on Android:

android list targets
  list targets

android create avd --force --name myCordova --target 1 --abi default/x86
  creates avd; can also be done in gui running android

cordova run --debug --emulator --target=myCordova android
  launches emulator

cordova run --debug --emulator android
  reinstalls and runs application in emulator

cordova run --debug android
  installs application on device
