This repository is meant to be a working example of the bug I have encountered within my program. The stackoverflow question can be found <HERE>.

How to Run
-------------------

To run on an android device, please follow the instructions in webiss-mobile/README.

When cordova builds, the files in webiss-mobile/platforms/android/assets/www will be overwritten by the files in webiss. So to change those parts of the program, simply change them in the webiss folder.


Important Files
-------------------

The main css code we use is in webiss/style/main.css.
The html page used is in webiss/index.html.
The main javascript file used is in webiss/js/Main.js.
